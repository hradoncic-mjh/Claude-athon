Can you create an image of a great dane, about 2 years old, with a completely white background, he should be facing and making eye contact with the camera, and should look happy. 
He should be sitting down, and it should only be showing him from his chest up. The photo dimensions should be 3x4

#5 Now narrow down this list to be limited to things that different breeds will be afflicted with this more or less likely. 
For example, all breeds are at the same level of risk for smoke inhalation, so that should not be on the list. 
But different breeds might have different risk levels for heart problems, so things with that variance between breeds should stay on the list

#5 
Given the following breed of animal and the list of diseases and issues below, 
can you create a csv that shows the likelihood of each disease/issue for that breed on percentage of presentation across animals in that breed
(created breedmalady.csv)


#6
Create a game in a single html file (game.html) called Predisposed where there are 5 rounds where points are scored by correct answer and timely responses and totalled together to give a final score after 5 rounds. 
Each round should display a breed on the left and a breed on the right. The image will be at the addess "/images/{breedname}.png. breedmalady.csv has the breakdown of all the breeds and maladies that should be found in the game.
In the center, there should be 5 maladies that have at least 5 points of difference in percentage between the two breeds. The player must select which breed is more predisposed to each malady. 
Points are awarded based on the percentage difference and how quickly the player answers. After 5 rounds, the total score is displayed along with a breakdown of which answers were correct and which were incorrect.

#7
I want the pictures to be bigger, and the maladies that are currently in between the images, they can be below the 2 images. 
They should still be in the center but you should be able to drag and drop the maladies to a drop zone below either the left or right breed

#8
The name of breed of animal should be hidden and should be another way to earn points. Where the names of the breeds are should be textboxes, and when the user unfocuses the textbox, it should check whether or not the user typed in the wrong breed or if they were correct. 
If correct, they earn bonus points. Either way, the name of the breed is then displayed under the image after the user has guessed
