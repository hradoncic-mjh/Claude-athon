Create a fully interactive word game of cryptograms. There should be an ability to start a new game, and a score to see how many games you have won. Your score should start at 1000 points, but deduct 100 points every time the user types a letter in the wrong spot. If a letter is typed in a correct spot, the letter should fill in for all of the same letter. Once all the letters are correctly filled in, the puzzle is solved and the game is won. The points get attributed to the user and a celebratory animation plays.
About the game: It should follow the rules of cryptograms. The word or phrase is filled in with letters that are incorrect, but follow the pattern of each letter representing a different letter. The interface should show blank spaces with a letter in each space. The user should be able to select a space which will highlight the character and either allow the user to type a letter as a guess or select from a button list of all the english characters.
About the cryptogram word and phrases: A list in javascript can be iterated through to refer to all the answers. The list should all be things that are between 20 and 50 characters long and have to do with things that veterinarian doctors deal with or should have knowlege about.
