Create an interactive Word Search Quiz game with the following specifications:
Core Concept
A word search puzzle where questions appear one at a time. Users must answer quiz questions to know which words to find in the grid. The game tracks time and hints to calculate scores.
Game Flow

Questions appear ONE AT A TIME (not all at once)
User reads the question and searches for the answer in the grid
User selects letters in the grid by clicking/dragging to form words
System AUTO-CHECKS selections immediately - if correct, word is found
User clicks "Next" button to proceed to next question
Process repeats until all questions are answered

Grid Specifications

Configurable grid size (e.g., 15x15, 20x20) - set manually by creator
Validation required: Before game starts, validate that all words can fit in the specified grid size. Show warning if grid is too small
Word placement: Words can appear in ALL 8 DIRECTIONS (horizontal, vertical, diagonal - both forwards and backwards)
Overlapping allowed: Words may share letters
Random letter fill: Empty cells filled with random letters

Question System

Display ONE question at a time prominently
Question formats should support rich text for veterinary terminology
After word is found, user must click "Next" to advance to next question
Questions should be numbered

Hint System (Sequential Access)
Three hint levels that must be used IN ORDER:

Hint 1 (-10 points): Reveal first letter + word length (e.g., "C_____ (6 letters)")
Hint 2 (-25 points): Reveal first and last letters (e.g., "C____E")
Hint 3 (-50 points): Fill in alternating letters OR highlight word location in grid
User must use Hint 1 before Hint 2 becomes available
User must use Hint 2 before Hint 3 becomes available

Timer System (Both Optional & Configurable)

Global timer: Counts total time for entire puzzle (optional, configurable duration)
Per-question timer: Counts time for each individual question (optional, configurable duration)
When per-question timer expires: AUTO-REVEAL the answer in the grid, strike it through, and wait for the user to click 'NEXT' to advance to next question
Both timers should be visible when enabled
Timers should be pausable

Visual Feedback

Word selection: Click and drag to select letters, show visual highlight during selection
Auto-check: Immediately validate selection - if correct, apply found word styling
Found words:

Apply strikethrough to the question text
Fade letters in grid to a "completed" color (muted/greyed out)
Keep word visible but distinguish it from unfound words


Progress indicators:

Question counter: "Question 3 of 10"
Progress bar showing overall completion


Running score: Display current score throughout the game (updates in real-time)

Scoring System

Base points per word: 100 points
Time bonus: Faster completion = multiplier on global timer
Hint penalties: -10 for Hint 1, -25 for Hint 2, -50 for Hint 3
Per-question overtime: If question timer expires, apply penalty
Display final score and statistics at end (total time, hints used, accuracy)

Configuration Options (for game creator)

Enable/disable global timer + set duration
Enable/disable per-question timer + set duration
